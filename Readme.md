You are given an array of integers which describe elevation at each point in a 2D landscape.
For example, the input [ 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 2 1 ] describes a landscape that looks like this:

Water will fall down on the landscape, filling up anywhere that it's not able to fall off.
Find the total "area" of water that would be collected in the landscape.
For example, for the input [ 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 2 1 ], the result should be 4
